<b><p style ="font-size:35px; color:red ;">Views</p><br>
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

<br>A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

<br>You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.
<b><p style ="font-size:25px; color:blue ;"> Create Views</p><br>
<br>A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement. 

<br><b>CREATE VIEW Syntax</b>
<br>CREATE VIEW view_name AS
<br>SELECT column1, column2, ...
<br>FROM table_name
<br>WHERE condition;
<br><b>CREATE VIEW Example</b>
<br>The following SQL creates a view that shows all customers from Brazil:

<br>ExampleGet your own SQL Server
<br>CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
<br>SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
<br>FROM Customers
<br>WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
<br><b><p style ="font-size:25px; color:blue ;"> Update Views</p><br>
<br>There are certain conditions needed to be satisfied to update a view.
<br> If any one of these conditions is not met, then we will not be allowed to update the view.

<br>The SELECT statement which is used to create the view should not include GROUP BY clause or ORDER BY clause.
<br>The SELECT statement should not have the DISTINCT keyword.
<br>The View should have all NOT NULL values.
<br>The view should not be created using nested queries or complex queries.
<br>The view should be created from a single table. If the view is created using multiple tables then we will not be allowed to update the view.
<br>A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement.

<br><br><b>Syntax</b>
<br>CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
<br>SELECT column1, column2, ...
<br>FROM table_name
<br>WHERE condition;
<br>The following SQL adds the "City" column to the "Brazil Customers" view:

<br><b>Example</b>
<br>CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
<br>SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City
<br>FROM Customers
<br>WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
<br><b><p style ="font-size:25px; color:blue ;"> Dropping a Views</p><br>
<br>A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW statement.

<br><b>DROP VIEW Syntax</b>
<br>DROP VIEW view_name;
<br>The following SQL drops the "Brazil Customers" view:

<br><b>Example</b>
<br>DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers];
