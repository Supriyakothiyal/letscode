        <h2>Subquery</h2>
        <p>A subquery is a SELECT statement that is nested within another SELECT statement or another SQL statement, such as an UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT statement. It can be used to return a single value, a single row, or multiple rows. A subquery must be enclosed in parentheses and placed in the WHERE clause or the HAVING clause:</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="correlated-subquery">
        <h2>Correlated Subquery</h2>
        <p>A correlated subquery is a subquery that depends on the outer query for its values. It is used to compare values from the outer query with values from the inner query. A correlated subquery must be enclosed in parentheses and placed in the WHERE clause:</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>SELECT column_name
FROM table_name t1
WHERE condition = (SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name t2 WHERE t1.column_name = t2.column_name);</code></pre>
